# Tövis Robo Club
TövisCsapat Robotics has started its first team in 2014 on the First Lego League robot programming competition.

The team has connected several kids with STEAM and programming in the past and learnt the basics of programming and during the years had opportunity to deep dive into the challenges of learning in the future, waste management, raising and protecting animals, human water management, space science and city construction among others.

We are quite proud that as TövisCsapat have encouraged these kids to spend countless engineering hours and joy, achieving awesome results with teams TövisCsapat and TövisASAP in World Festival. Eversince as kids in the club engage in FIRST LEGO League Junior, World Robot Olympiad Robomission and Future Innovators category and we transformed to Tövis Robo Club.

Together with fantastic teams and persons we understood that the most we can gain is what we learn, not what we win.
